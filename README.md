# pisound-patches
various audio patches for the pisounds platform

Make sure you've done the standard PiSound setup:
https://blokas.io/pisound/docs/

Then install PD as described here:
https://blokas.io/pisound/docs/Pisound-Config/

These patches are setup to use the PiSound App:
https://blokas.io/pisound/docs/Pisound-App/

## Patch installation

1. Install dependencies
Many of these patches will need Pure Data externals compiled and installed. Where I can I will include the Raspberry Pi compiled external with the patch.

2. Install Patch files
The easiest way to install the patch files is to copy the project folders to a USB stick and use the method described here:
